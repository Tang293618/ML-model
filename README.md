# Models-of-Structure-Prediction
This is a repository of the models and algorithms related to structure prediction.

My collaborator and I are going to establish some simple models to achieve our goals in the following two aspects.

  1. Once a certain structure is given, a prediction value on its total potential energy can be generated.
	
  2. Once several structures with respect to a specific kind of molecular or crystal, no matter that substance is known or not, are generated, we can calculate the global minimal energy and consequently demonstrate the corresponding stable structure.
