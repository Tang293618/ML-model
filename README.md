# ML-model
This is a repository of the models and algorithms related to structure prediction.

My cooperator and I are going to establish some simple models to achieve our goals in the following two aspects.

	1. Once a certain structure is given, we shall be able to generate a prediction value on its total potential energy.
	
	2. Once several structures with respect to a specific kind of molecular or crystal, no matter that substance is known or not, are generated, we shall be able to calculate the global minimal energy and consequently demonstrate the corresponding stable structure.
